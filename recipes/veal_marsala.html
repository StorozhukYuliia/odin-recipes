    <p>Steps</p>

        <li>Place veal between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound veal with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and seasoning salt in a shallow dish; dredge veal in flour mixture and let rest on a wire rack for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add floured cutlets and cook until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Add mushrooms, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in Marsala and simmer until veal is tender and sauce is hot, about 5 minutes more. Serve immediately.</li>
